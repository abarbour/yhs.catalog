#	Yang, Hauksson and Shearer:
#	Refined earthquake focal mechanism catalog for southern California (1981 - 2010)
#
#
#	A refined earthquake focal mechanism catalog for southern Califiornia using the 
#	HASH method and locations derived from waveform cross-correlation. Each focal 
#	mechanism is obtained from grid searching for the best-fitting double-couple 
#	focal mechanism solution to both the P-wave first motion records that were 
#	picked by network analysts, and the S/P amplitude ratios computed from 
#	three-component seismograms. This dataset includes around 179,000 focal 
#	mechanisms for earthquakes occurring 1981 through 2010 in southern
#	California region. Updated datasets for 2011-2019 have been added
#	below.
